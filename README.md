Create a new wish by filling in the product name, URL, price and delivery timeframe for the product you would like to wish for along with the quantity and occasion.

Look up someone else's wishes by providing their username. 

Filter the results based on your chosen price bracket and occasion of birthday, wedding or anniversary. 

Sort by the date added and quantity of items you or your friend would like. 

Get inspired and see all the products everyone has wished for. 

To use, simply navigate via the keyboard and use the up/down arrows and hit return to execute a command. 

Wish quantities can be updated or deleted entirely. 

Make a wish come true by opening the selected product directly in your browser.
